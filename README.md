# Student Welfare Association — Landing Page

This is a small static landing page for the Student Welfare Association. It includes a responsive hero, events, services, join form (frontend only) and contact info.

How to use

- Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or use a local static server).
- Files added:
  - `index.html` — main page
  - `assets/css/styles.css` — styles
  - `assets/js/script.js` — small interactivity (nav, smooth scroll, form handler)

Notes

- The join form is front-end only and shows a confirmation alert. Replace with real backend endpoint if you need persistence.
- Images are hotlinked from Unsplash for demo purposes; swap them for local assets for production.
